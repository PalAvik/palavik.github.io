I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). Prior to this, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/) in the NVIDIA vertical, where I focused on applied AI research. I hold a B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](https://vnit.ac.in/), completed in 2020.

My primary research interests include computer vision, deep learning, multi-modal learning, and foundation models. As part of my Master's thesis, I am exploring multi-modal understanding through hyperbolic geometry under the supervision of [Dr. Pascal Mettes](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.s.m.mettes/) and [Prof. Fabio Galasso](https://fgalasso.bitbucket.io/) as an [ELLIS MSc Honours](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/) student. I am currently applying for PhD positions, and I invite reviewers to explore my profile.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy reading fiction, watching space documentaries and movies, and traveling.
