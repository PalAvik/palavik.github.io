I am a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). Previously I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/) within the NVIDIA vertical working in applied AI research. I completed my bachelors (B.Tech. 2020) in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](https://vnit.ac.in/).

My research interests lie in computer vision, multi-modal learning, and geometric deep learning. I am currently working towards my Masters Thesis in multi-modal understanding using hyperbolic geometry under the guidance of [Dr. Pascal Mettes](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.s.m.mettes/) as an Honours student at ELLIS unit Amsterdam with [Prof. Fabio Galasso](https://fgalasso.bitbucket.io/) as external advisor. I am in the process of applying for suitable PhD positions in academia and hence cordially invite reviewers to browse my profile.
