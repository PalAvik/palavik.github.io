description: The goals of this study were to replicate the results of the original study introducing Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB). Extended to provide alternative approaches to mitigate the problem of Long Range Interactions (LRI) in graphs and to provide a better characterisation of which of LRI factors are most important and finally to assess whether the LRGB was indeed a good benchmark for LRI.
